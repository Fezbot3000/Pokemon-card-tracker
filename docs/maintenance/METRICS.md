# Development Metrics Log

Purpose: Track key metrics per flow for adherence and efficiency as defined in Development Rules v2.4.

- Flow: Architecture Remediation (v1.0)
  - Start: 2025-08-08
  - Time spent: TBD
  - Rework cycles: 0
  - Adherence rate (quality gates first-pass): TBD
  - Notes:
    - ErrorBoundary refinement completed
    - Firebase unification imports migrated
    - Storage rules clarified
    - CI workflow added

- Flow: Tailwind CSS Migration
  - Start: 2025-02-05
  - Phase 1 (Button Standardization): 2 hours
    - Components affected: 20+
    - Rework cycles: 3 (color change, display fix, glass variant)
    - Adherence rate: 90% (minor rework for visual consistency)
  - Phase 2 (Atom Components): 3 hours
    - Components migrated: 7 (Button, FormLabel, TextField, NumberField, Toggle, SelectField, ImageUploadButton)
    - Issues: CSS variable naming, dark mode compatibility
    - Adherence rate: 95% (smooth after establishing pattern)
  - Phase 3 (Molecules): 5 hours
    - Components migrated: 15 (FormField, Card, ConfirmDialog, BottomSheet, SettingsPanel, ColorCategory, ComponentSection, InvoiceCard, CustomDropdown, InvoiceHeader, Dropdown, ActionSheet + CSS for Modal)
    - CSS files created: 17
    - Rework cycles: 0
    - Adherence rate: 100%
  - Phase 4 (Organisms): 1 hour (in progress)
    - Components migrated: 3 (Footer, NavigationBar, BottomNavBar)
    - CSS files created: 3
    - Rework cycles: 0
    - Adherence rate: 100%
  - Total Progress:
    - Total time: 11 hours
    - Components migrated: 48+ (7 atoms + 15 molecules + 3 organisms + 20+ buttons)
    - Estimated completion: ~70%
  - Efficiency gains:
    - Reduced development time by using established patterns
    - Average 25 minutes per atom component
    - Average 24 minutes per molecule component
    - Consistent dark mode support via CSS variables
    - Pre-creating CSS files speeds migration
  - Notes:
    - One-at-a-time approach proved effective
    - CSS variables provide automatic theme switching
    - BEM naming convention adopted for semantic classes
