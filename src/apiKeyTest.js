// API Key Test File
// Use this to verify your API key with Firebase

/*
Step 1: Go to your Firebase Console:
- Project Settings (gear icon)
- General tab
- Your apps section
- Click on your web app (</> icon)
- Copy the entire config including the API key

Step 2: Verify the format
- Firebase API keys typically look like: AIzaSyC1a_AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQ
- They usually start with "AIzaSy" followed by a mix of letters and numbers
- They DON'T have spaces or special characters

Step 3: Replace the key in src/config/firebase.js:
- Copy just the apiKey value from your Firebase console
- Replace the existing apiKey in the firebase.js file
- Restart your development server

// Example test:
// If your Firebase API key is valid, it should match this format:
// const validKeyPattern = /^AIzaSy[A-Za-z0-9_-]{33}$/;
