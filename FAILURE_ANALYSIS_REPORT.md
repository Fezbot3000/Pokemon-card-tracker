# Failure Analysis Report

## What I Tried
- Targeted `src/design-system/components/Header.js` to remove unused imports/variables
- Removed: `useLocation`, `useAuth`, `baseColors`, `onImportClick`, `location` variable, `user/logout` variables
- Used `search_replace` tool to make changes
- Expected to reduce warning count from 1019

## How It Failed
- Warning count remained at 1019 (0% reduction)
- Left other unused imports in same file: `Button`, `Dropdown`, `DropdownItem`, `DropdownDivider`
- Left unused variables: `previousView`, `isAnimating`
- Incomplete file cleanup meant minimal actual impact

## Why I Won't Try This Again
- Piecemeal approach wastes time with no measurable progress
- Fixing individual warnings without completing entire files is ineffective
- Cannot claim success without verified total count reduction
- 6 warnings fixed out of 1019 total is insignificant impact

## What I'll Do Differently
- Identify files with highest warning counts first
- Fix ALL warnings in a file before moving to next file
- Verify total warning count reduction after each complete file fix
- Track progress: 1019 → 1015 → 1010 → etc.
- Only target files with 10+ warnings for maximum impact
